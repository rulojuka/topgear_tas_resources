Nitro player one:
  - 001E6C and 001E6D
    - The upper part of 001E6C is the counter that goes from 3 to 0
    - 001E6D remains at zero when the nitro is not active and act as a counter up to FF when the nitro stops, the upper part of 001E6C is subtracted by one and its (001E6D) value returns to zero.
   
Nitro player two (probably) is the same at 001E6E and 001E6F.
